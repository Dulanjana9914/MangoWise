    description:
      "Anthracnose is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, including trees, shrubs, and fruits. It is characterized by the development of irregularly shaped lesions on various plant parts, such as leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. These lesions often have dark borders and lighter centers, giving them a distinctive appearance. In severe cases, the infected leaves may experience premature drop, leading to reduced plant health and vigor. Anthracnose spreads through spores, which are often spread by water splash or wind. Proper plant spacing, pruning, and sanitation can help manage the disease. Fungicides can also be used in severe cases.",
    organic:
      "Prune affected plant parts to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant. Applying copper-based fungicides can help manage the disease organically. Additionally, maintaining proper plant hygiene by cleaning up fallen leaves and debris can prevent the disease from spreading.",
    chemical:
      "Chemical fungicides containing active ingredients like chlorothalonil or mancozeb can be used to control anthracnose. These fungicides should be applied according to the manufacturer's instructions and in conjunction with good cultural practices.",

    disease: "Sooty Mold",
    symptoms: [
      "Black or dark brown powdery on leaves, stems, and fruits",
      "Leaves may die and fall off",
    ],
    description:
      "Sooty mold can be found on mango trees and any other plants that have previously been fed upon by insects. The mold grows on honeydew, a sticky, sugary secretion that is produced by some insects to attract fellow bugs. Using the honeydew as a food source, the mold gradually covers the surface of the affected plant part, coloring it in various shades of black. Sooty molds are non-parasitic and non-pathogenic fungi, so they do not colonize plant tissues or trigger symptoms. However, they alter the ability of the plant to perform photosynthesis and to exchange gases with the atmosphere. Severely infected leaves may die and fall off, thereby affecting the plants growth and survival.",
    organic:
      "Use formulations of neem oil, which is an organic broad spectrum compound, to ward off whiteflies, aphids, scales, ants, and mealy bugs. Neem oil also reduces the growth of the fungus itself. Insecticidal soap or dish soap (e.g. one tablespoon per 5 liters of water) can be sprayed on affected plants. After letting the soap solution settle on the plants, it can be rinsed off, thereby removing the mold.",
    chemical:
      "Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Synthetic insecticides of the organophosphate family can be used to prevent insects from feeding on the plant.",

    disease: "Powdery Mildew",
    symptoms: [
      "White or gray powdery spots on leaves, stems, and flowers",
      "Distorted or stunted growth of new shoots",
      "Premature dropping of infected leaves",
    ],
    description:
      "Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, including ornamentals, vegetables, and fruits. It is characterized by the appearance of white or gray powdery spots on the surfaces of leaves, stems, and flowers. These spots can coalesce and cover larger areas, leading to the distortion of leaves and other plant parts. New shoots may exhibit stunted growth, and infected leaves often drop prematurely, affecting the plant's overall health. Powdery mildew thrives in conditions of high humidity and moderate temperatures. Proper spacing, pruning, and increasing air circulation can help prevent its spread.",
    organic:
      "Spraying affected plants with a solution of baking soda (1 tablespoon), dish soap (1 teaspoon), and water (1 gallon) can help control powdery mildew. Neem oil and sulfur-based fungicides are also effective organic treatments.",
    chemical:
      "Fungicides containing active ingredients like sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, or myclobutanil can be used to treat powdery mildew. These chemical treatments should be used as directed and in conjunction with cultural practices that promote disease prevention.",
